This is an R package containing the model code for the Distributed Climate Water Balance Model, described in:

**Moore, R.D., Trubilowicz, J.W. and Buttle, J.M. (2012)**, Prediction of Streamflow Regime and Annual Runoff for Ungauged Basins Using a Distributed Monthly Water Balance Model. Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 48: 32â€“42. doi: 10.1111/j.1752-1688.2011.00595.x

To install (for research version):
